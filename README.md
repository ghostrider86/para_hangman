# para_hangman overview
This is a simple game of hangman but instead of being hanged its a parachute. I hope that as I continue to practice using several languages that ill get a better grasp on devloping code and have experiance in several languages, which will help in my overall goal to become a excellent software engineer. This projects has the following charecteristics:
The game asks the user to guess a word and keeps asking for a word till the player wins or loses. The game takes user input which for this game takes input from the keybored. 
I also added a stretch challenges which is accesing a file, which in this programs case is the word file that the program takes random words from.
I wrote this for the purpose of streatching myself and gain a deeper knowledge and appreciation to writing programs.
